  * Significant rewrite with many improvements and fixes:
      - refactored code and added lots of comments on its logic and
        thinking. This should make it easier to follow and contribute
        to the code, and also serves to remind us what's going on in
        the future.
      - simplified code and moved common logic to separate functions.
        This allows the event handler code to be simpler and easier to
        maintain.
      - simplified app description and parameters to make it more
        concise and easier to understand.
      - renamed some functions to match those in ST documentation.
      - added/improved logging messages to better monitor app state,
        including location name and sensor name.
      - get, process, and store input values in init function instead
        of when they are used. This is more clear and allows better
        handling of optional parameters.
  * Feature changes and bug fixes:
      - improved initial sunmode state when the app is installed, so
        it works correctly when the app is installed or reconfigured
        while the system is in away mode.
      - preserve sunmode state when the app is reconfigured.
        Previously, init() is called on re-configure, so the app state
        is reset. Now when you reconfigure the app, sun info gathered
        from previous sunrise handler is not lost, even if the
        system is in away mode, so the currect mode is applied when
        events occurs after reconfigure and before the sunrise/sunset
        event fires.
      - send notification after mode is changed, not before.
      - sendPushMessage is now a bool so it shows up in the UI as a
        yes/no slider.
      - updated notification message to include location name. This
        makes it easy to understand what's affected if multiple
        locations are in use without needing to customize app name.
      - on app install, set location to correct mode instead of
        waiting until the next presence sensor/sun event change.
